# CUDA Otsu Implementation

This project provides a CUDA-accelerated implementation of Otsu's method for image thresholding. By leveraging GPU computation, it achieves significant performance improvements over traditional CPU-based implementations.

## Build and Run

To build and run the project, use the following commands:

```bash
make clean
make
./example
```

The `example` executable demonstrates how to use the CUDA Otsu implementation. Modify the example code as needed to integrate it into your own projects.
